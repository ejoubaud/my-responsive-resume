        text: |
          The way I see it, Web development is not just any job.
          
          Both software and the Web are relatively new industries, in which not only the methods and tools of production, but the products themselves evolve at a crazy pace. Just keeping up requires a great deal of work, interest and curiosity. In one word&nbsp;: passion.
          
          You need to read books, watch talks, follow blogs, try products, figure out wether and how they can help, care about what works and what doesn't, constantly seek to improve your way of doing. You always must get better. And it takes work, time and passion.
          
          I do Web development because I love that stuff, and most of all, I love getting better at it. One of the best parts is that you never get out of new things to learn.

          Softwares arguably count among the "most complex products":http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~cah/G51ISS/Documents/NoSilverBullet.html a craftman can build.
          
          Building software right requires a constant commitment to quality. To deliver it in time and at an acceptable cost, you also need a strong focus on productivity.
          
          Both these domains have known the most interesting progresses over the last years, with the growing success of new packaging and deployment tools, automated testing and continous integration, agile methodologies and innovative frameworks.
          
          As a developer, I regard applying these innovations to the improvement of my work's quality and productivity as one of the most exciting parts of my day.

      - title: "What I am into"
        text: |
          After a few years working on professional projects in Java/J2EE and PHP, I am now immerging myself into the universe of Ruby On Rails and agile methodologies, partly because of their elegance, but mostly for their emphasis on innovation, testing and automation.
          
          I'll be highly motivated by any opportunity to improve my skills and experience into these specific domains.
          
          I will also gladly consider offers to leverage my experience and commitment to quality on a Java, PHP, CMS, or more widely any Web-related project.
          
          So if you're interested in giving me the pleasure to build great stuff for you, please send me an email.
