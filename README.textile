h1. My Responsive Resume

My Responsive Resume is the easiest way to build an online, nice-looking and responsive resume to impress your next employer.

It uses "Middleman":http://middlemanapp.com/ for static site generation, "Yaml":http://www.yaml.org/ and "Textile":http://textile.thresholdstate.com/ to store your resume's information, and a "fluid squares":http://fluidsquares.com/ layout to display them.

It sounds complicated but it is really fast and simple. You just need to fill a file with your resume's informations, and throw a couple of command lines. Just follow the steps below and get your resume up and running in a few minutes.


h1. Manual

h2. Pre-requisites

You just need "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ and "Bundler":http://gembundler.com/ installed to generate your site.

These are pretty common and useful tools, but if you don't have them already, just follow the links for instructions.

You also need a host Web server to deploy your resume to. My Responsive Resume generates only static pages, so really any server will do.

No need for it to run PHP, Ruby, Java or anything. You just drop the generated files and it's done.


h2. Get My Responsive Resume

Just "fork this repository":https://github.com/ejoubaud/my-responsive-resume/fork/ , and clone it on your computer.

Then go to your project folder and run the bundler install in a command line :

bc. cd /path/to/my-responsive-resume/
bundle install


h2. Edit your resume

You can edit your resume's information in @data/resume.yml@.

It uses a "Yaml":http://www.yaml.org/ syntax, which is easy to read and write. Take inspiration from the examples, and just be careful to *respect the indentation*.

The structure of this file should be pretty intuitive, but here is a quick description :

* Your resume is divided into *sections*. Each section will be represented as a square on your resume. Each section has a key (the identifier, e.g. _experience_), a *title* (the display title, e.g. _Experience_) and a list of *points*.
* *Points* are subdivisions of your section. Depending on your section, a point can be a training you made, a job you had, or a domain of skills you master.
* Each *point* must have a display *title*, and a *text*.
* Each *point* may have a *date*, and some labelled *data*.
* Labelled *data* are just additional data about your point (client, employer...) with a label. In _Client: My client_, _Client_ is the label and _My client_ is the data. They will be displayed beneath your point's title to add additional informations about the point. They are optional.
* The points' *title*, *data* and *text* are compiled with "Textile":http://textile.thresholdstate.com/, so feel free to use links or lists.

h2. Test it

Run the Middleman server:

bc. bundle exec middleman

Then you should be able to see your resume in any browser by typing @http://localhost:4567@

If you change the Yaml data, you must stop the server and restart it to see the changes.

h2. Deploy

Build the static site with the following command in your project directory:

bc. bundle exec middleman build

Then just upload the content of the generated @build@ folder onto your Web host.

h1. FAQ

h2. Why use Textile instead of the more widespread Markdown ?

Some Yaml data needed to be included in the page without being wrapped with @<p>@ tags. Markdown doesnot allow that. Textile does just by adding a whitespace before the line.
